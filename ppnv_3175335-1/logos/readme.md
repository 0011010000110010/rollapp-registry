Hey there!
PPNV Service in touch! :)
We are a team of programmers with extensive experience in testing the Cosmos ecosystem blockchain POS networks. 
Our team has been participating in testnets for more than 2 years and we help projects from the very early start. 
We provide all the necessary services to help the community:

✔️ API/REST Endpoint
✔️ RPC Endpoint
✔️ gRPC Endpoint
✔️ Web gRPC Endpoint
✔️ Genesis files
✔️ IBC Relayers
✔️ Seed Node
✔️ Live Peers
✔️ Addrbook file
✔️ State Sync

Our team uses only high-quality, reliable and expensive servers around the world. 
We use various means to constantly monitor the status of our validators 24/7. 
Our team always completes all necessary network updates and voting on proposals on time.

Many projects have already chosen us as main validators in mainnets. 
Today we serve more than 30 networks and the number is constantly growing.
